abstract: Current e-commerce companies are trying to create shopping applications in virtual reality (VR), because interactive 3D product information designs are believed to enrich the online shopping experience. However, existing designs of 3D product information have some shortcomings and lack of systematic guidance. Therefore, how to redesign the 3D product information in VR application is an essential challenge. In this work, we review and analyze previous design cases of 3D product information design and construct a design space, which contains three dimensions:visual presentation, user interaction, and spatial relation. Then nine new 3D information designs are produced by combining elements in the design space. After that, we investigate the users’ shopping experience and task efficiency based on the user evaluation results. The results indicate that, when adopting a specific spatial relation, both spatial memory and task efficiency are influenced by differences in the information formats of visual presentation dimension, while user experience is affected by differences in information presentation mode of visual presentation dimension. Finally, we provide suggestions and guidelines for future 3D information design.
