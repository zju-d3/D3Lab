abstract: Current 3D product information pages are believed to enrich the online shopping experience since it provides a more immersive experience. However, existing solutions still retain the 2D UI elements in the product information design, preventing users from fully immersing themselves in the virtual environment and further degrading the shopping experience. Therefore, how to redesign the presentation of product information in a virtual environment is an essential challenge. In this work, we first construct a design space based on previous design cases of product information design in virtual environments, which contains three dimensions-visual presentation, user interaction and spatial relation. Then nine new 3D information design solutions are produced by combining elements in the design space. After that, we devised a user study to compare these solutions and investigate how different dimensions affect users’ shopping experience and task efficiency of the primary objective in shopping. The results reveal that users’ spatial memory and task efficiency are both impacted by how information is organized in terms of visual presentation dimension, and that users’ hedonic experiences are influenced by the differences in the constituent elements of information. It is found that the different spatial relationship between 3D information and 3D product lead to differences in pragmatic quality.
