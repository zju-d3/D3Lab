abstract: Programming has become an essential component of K-12 education and serves as a pathway for developing computational thinking skills. Given the complexity of programming and the advanced skills it requires, previous research has introduced user-friendly tools to support young learners. However, our interviews with six programming educators revealed that current tools often fail to reflect classroom learning objectives, offer flexible, high-quality guidance, and foster student creativity. This highlights the need for more adaptive and reflective tools. Therefore, we introduced MindScratch, a multimodal generative AI (GAI) powered visual programming support tool. MindScratch aims to balance structured classroom activities with free programming creation, supporting students in completing creative programming projects based on teacher-set learning objectives while also providing programming scaffolding. Our user study results indicate that, compared to the baseline, MindScratch more effectively helps students achieve high-quality projects aligned with learning objectives. It also enhances students’ computational thinking skills and creative thinking. Overall, we believe that GAI-driven educational tools like MindScratch offer students a focused and engaging learning experience.
