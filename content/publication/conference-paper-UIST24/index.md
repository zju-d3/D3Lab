abstract: Rapid creation of novel product appearance designs that align with consumer emotional requirements poses a significant challenge. Text-to-image models, with their excellent image generation capabilities, have demonstrated potential in providing inspiration to designers. However, designers still encounter issues including aligning emotional needs, expressing design intentions, and comprehending generated outcomes in practical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce AutoSpark, an interactive system that integrates Kansei Engineering and generative AI to provide creativity support for designers in creating automobile appearance designs that meet emotional needs. AutoSpark employs a Kansei Engineering engine powered by generative AI and a semantic network to assist designers in emotional need alignment, design intention expression, and prompt crafting. It also facilitates designers’ understanding and iteration of generated results through fine-grained image-image similarity comparisons and text-image relevance assessments. The design-thinking map within its interface aids in managing the design process. Our user study indicates that AutoSpark effectively aids designers in producing designs that are more aligned with emotional needs and of higher quality compared to a baseline system, while also enhancing the designers’ experience in the human-AI co-creation process.
